Project Information:

This project if a file sharing system that allows access to the following functionalities: Download, Upload, Open and Preview.



Improvements:

I added the follwing functionality:

1. Preview a file - This will allow you to select any local or shared file and generate a preview of the file by clicking the "Preview" button. It will then display this preview to the UI.

2. Open a file - This will allow you to open any file from the Local_Shared_Drive in Notepad.Aswell as if you select a file from the shared drive, it will download that file to your local drive, then open that text file in Notepad.

How to Run File:

1. Open the Assignment2 project in IntelliJ
2. Go to Run -> Edit Configurations -> Main -> Program Arguments -> Enter [Computer Name] [Local_Shared_Folder]
3. Expand: Assignment2 -> src -> sample
4. Right Click on fileServer -> select "Run 'fileServer.main()'"
5. Rick Click on Main -> select "Run 'Main'"
